#==============
#Do not change the version on repeated build, and check the checksum and content of jar.
#If it is equal, it is a reproduces build. The $VERSION is important 
#  because it determines the timestamp and hence the checksum in the jar file. 

#Set the version newly here to the current date if the sources are changed in jar and checksum.
#If the relevant sources are not change in functionality, may be changed in comment, 
#  it is not necessary the change this VERSION because the generated content is the same.
#The next line is the version for vishiaMiniSys:
export VERSION_MINISYS="2020-12-26"

#The SRCZIPFILE name will be written in MD5 file also for vishiaMiniSys.
#It should have anytime the stamp of the newest file, independing of the VERSION
