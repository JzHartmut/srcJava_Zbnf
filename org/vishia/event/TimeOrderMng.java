/**Class to manage {@link TimeOrderBase} with an extra thread.
 * This class can be used in twice forms:
 * <ul>
 * <li>The thread executes the time orders. This may be a thread for @link {@link StateMachine}
 *   especially. 
 * <li>The thread manages only the time for the orders. If the time is expired for any order
 *   that order is copied in a List of ready-to-run orders which can be executed from another thread
 *   which does some other things elsewhere too.  For this working principle the method {@link #step(int, long)} is given
 *   which should be called in the other thread usual cyclically. 
 * </ul>
 * For the second form with an extra execution thread the execution thread may implement the interface @link {@link ConnectionExecThread}. 
 * That is necessary if the thread may sleep a longer time, waits for work. But that is not necessary. 
 * The constructor @link {@link TimeOrderMng#TimeOrderMng(ConnectionExecThread)} can be called with null for this argument. 
 * But in that case the method {@link #close()} have to be called on end of the application.
 * <br><br>
 * This class contains a list of orders which can be run immediately or delayed. <br>
 * The class has a {@link #step(long)} method which should be invoked cyclically.
