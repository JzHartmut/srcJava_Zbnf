  /**Version and history.
   * <ul>
   * <li>2015-01-10 Hartmut renamed from <code>OrderForList</code>
   * <li>2014-02-23 Hartmut removed from the component srcJava_vishiaGui to the srcJava_vishiaBase 
   *   because it is commonly able to use.
   * <li>2012-02-14 Hartmut corr: {@link #addToList(GralGraphicThread, int)}:
   *   For time saving: If an instance is added already and its new execution time
   *   is up to 5 ms later, nothing is done. It saves time for more as one call of this routine
   *   in a fast loop.
   * <li>2012-02-14 Hartmut corr: It was happen that an instance was designated with {@link #bAdded}==true
   *   but it wasn't added, Therefore on {@link #addToList(GralGraphicThread, int)} it is removed
   *   from list and added newly. It is more save. 
   * <li>2012-01-26 Hartmut chg: rename removeFromGraphicThread(GralGraphicThread) 
   *   to {@link #removeFromList(GralGraphicThread)}. It is a better naming because it is removed from the queue
   *   in the graphic thread. This class is only used in that queue. 
   * <li>2012-01-15 Hartmut new: {@link #name} to identify, proper for debugging
   * <li>2012-01-08 Hartmut new: {@link #addToList(GralGraphicThread, int)} and 
   *   {@link #removeFromList(GralGraphicThread)} as thread-safe functions which 
   *   marks the instance as added (for delayed execution, for re-using).
   * <li>2010-06-00 Hartmut created.
