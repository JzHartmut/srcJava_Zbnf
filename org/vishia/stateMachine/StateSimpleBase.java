  /**Version, history and license.
   * <ul>
   * <li>2013-05-11 Hartmut chg: Override {@link #exitAction()} instead {@link #exit()}!
   * <li>2013-04-27 Hartmut chg: The {@link #entry(EventMsg2)} and the {@link #entryAction(EventMsg2)} should get the event
   *   from the transition. It needs adaption in users code. The general advantage is: The entry action can use data
   *   from the event. A user algorithm does not need to process the events data only in the transition. A user code
   *   can be executed both in a special transition to a state and as entry action. Both possibilities do not distinguish
   *   in formal possibilities. The second advantage is: If the event is used, it should given to the next entry. If it is
   *   not used, a 'null' should be given. The user need not pay attention in the correct usage of {@link #mEventConsumed} or not.
   * <li>2013-04-27 Hartmut new: {@link #mStateEntered} is returned on any {@link #entry(EventMsg2)}. If the state is not changed,
   *   a 'return 0;' should be written in the transition code. With the new bit especially the debugging can distinguish
   *   a state changed from a non-switching transition.    
   * <li>2013-04-13 Hartmut re-engineering: 
   *   <ul>
   *   <li>The property whether or not there are non-event transitions is set on ctor. It is a property
   *     established in source code, therefore it should be known in runtime after construction already.
   *     The entry method does not need to modified because non-event transitions. It may be better because the
   *     entry method's code should not depend on the trans method's content.  
   *   <li>entry is final, it can be final now. For overwriting the {@link #entryAction()} is given. It is more simple to use.  
   *   <li>The trans method is protected: It should not be called from outside in any case.
   *   </ul>
   * <li>2013-04-07 Hartmut adapt: Event<?,?> with 2 generic parameter
   * <li>2012-09-17 Hartmut improved.
   * <li>2012-08-30 Hartmut created. The experience with that concept are given since about 2001 in C-language and Java.
