 * Reason: If some bits should be read from a variable, and then other bits should be read,
 * the variable should be gotten from the target device only one time. Therefore it is only one
 * variable. But the access to several bits - or indices are described here.

   * <ul>
   * <li>2012-03-31 Hartmut created. The problem was: In a {@link org.vishia.gral.base.GralWidget}
   *   the element {@link #idx} was contained but not any mask. The mask will be used now. But indices
   *   and masks are not a problem of the widget in a GUI, it is a problem of access to the variable.
   *   But the implementation of {@link VariableAccess_ifc} should not containt this things
   *   because a variable is an entity of access to a target device data element.
   *   Therefore this meta class should be proper.
