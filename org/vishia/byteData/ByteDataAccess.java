/**This class is a base class to control the access to binary data.
 * The binary data may typically used or produced from a part of software written in C or C++.
 * There the binary data are struct-constructs. Another example - build of datagram structures.
 * <br>
 * This class is a base class which should be derived for user's necessities. 
 * The methods {@link #getInt16(int)} etc. are protected. That should prevent erratic free accesses to data 
 * at application level. A derived class of this class structures the software for byte data access.
 * <br><br> 
 * It is able to support several kinds of structured data access:<ul>
 * <li>Simple C-like <code>struct</code> are adequate mapped with a simple derived class of this class, 
 *     using the protected commonly access methods like {@link #_getLong(int, int)} with predefined indexes 
 *     in special methods like getValueXyz().</li>
 * <li>Complex <code>struct</code> with nested <code>struct</code> inside are mapped 
 *     with one derived class per <code>struct</code>, define one reference per nested struct 
 *     and overwriting the method {@link #assignDataToFixChilds()}</li>
 * <li>Base <code>struct</code> inside a <code>struct</code> (inheritance in C) can be mapped with 
 *     extra derived classes for the base struct and usind the
 *     {@link assignCasted_i(ByteDataAccess, int)}-method.</li>
 * <li>A pack of data with several struct may be mapped using the {@addChild(ByteDataAccess)}-method.
 *     Thereby a parent should be defined, and the structs of the pack are children of this parent. 
 *     That structs need not be from the same type.</li>
 * <li>packs of struct with parent are nestable, it is constructable as a tree of pack of structs. 
 *     The parent of the pack is the tree node. It is likewise a XML tree. 
 *     The data may be also transformed to a XML data representation
 *     or the data structure may be explained with a XML tree, but they are not
 *     XML data straight.</li>
 * </ul>
 * This application possibilities show a capable of development system to access binary data. 
 * The other, hand made way was calculate with indices of the byte[idx] specially user programmed. 
 * This class helps to make such complex index calculation needlessly. 
 * One struct at C level corresponds with one derivated class of ByteDataAccess. 
 * But last also a generation of the java code from C/C++-header files containing the structs is able to.
 * So the definition of byte positions are made only on one source. The C/C++ is primary thereby. 
 *      
 * <h2>children, currentChild, addChild</h2>
 * Children are used to evaluate or write different data structures after a known structure. 
 * The children may be from several derived types of this class. 
 * With children and children inside children a tree of different data can be built or evaluated.
 * 
 * If no child is added yet, the indices have the following values:
 * <ul>
 * <li>idxCurrentChild = -1.
 * <li>idxCurrentChildEnd = index after known (head-) data.
 * </ul>
 * <ul>
 * <li>idxCurrentChild = the index after the last known child or known (head-) data.
 *     It is idxCurrentChildEnd from state before.    
 * <li>idxCurrentChildEnd = -2, because the length of the child is unknown. 
 *     The -2 is used to mark call of next().
 * </ul>
 * A call of {@link addChild()} or its adequate addChildXY() sets the indices to the given current child:
 * <ul>
 * <li>idxCurrentChild = the index after known (first head-) data, the index of the child.
 * <li>idxCurrentChildEnd = idxCurrentChild + {@link specifyLengthElement()} if this method returns >=0.     
 * <li>idxCurrentChildEnd = idxCurrentChild + {@link specifyLengthElementHead()} if this method returns >=0.     
 * <li>idxCurrentChildEnd = -1, because the length of the child is not known yet if both methods return -1. 
 * </ul>
 * The length of the current Child may be set while evaluating the child's data. 
 * The user should call {@link #setLengthElement(int)} with the child 
 * or {@link #setLengthCurrentChildElement(int)} with the parent, respectively with this.
 * <ul>
 * <li>idxCurrentChild = is still the index of the child.
 * <li>idxCurrentChildEnd = idxCurrentChild + given length.
 * </ul>
 * If this methods are not called, but next() or addChild...() is called however, without a known length 
 * but this (the parent) knows the rules to determine the length of its possible children, 
 * it is possible to do that. The method {@link specifyLengthCurrentChildElement()} supplied the number of bytes.
 * But if this method is not overwritten in the inherited class, an exception is thrown.
 * 
 *

 * followed object model diagram, <br>

 * <code> <>---> </code>is a aggregation, <code> <|---- </code>is a inherition.

  /**The version. 
   * <ul>
   * <li>2014-08-23: Creating of class ByteDataAccessBase, more simple for C-usage, expecially without virtual methods.
   * <li>2014-01-12 Hartmut new: Java4C.inline for C-compilation. 
   * <li>2013-12-08 Hartmut new: {@link #ByteDataAccess(int, int)} as super constructor with given head and data size.
   *   {@link #addChild(ByteDataAccess)} accepts an initialized not used child. Uses {@link #kInitializedWithLength}.
   *   That is the possibility to work without dynamic linked methods {@link #specifyLengthElement()} etc. for proper work
   *   especially for C usage. The overridden methods {@link #specifyEmptyDefaultData()}, {@link #notifyAddChild()} etc.
   *   are proper to use in C too with the concept of the dynamic linked methods, but there does not be necessary.
   *   It is an optimizing for C. Maybe in future the {@link #specifyLengthElement()} and {@link #specifyLengthElementHead()}
   *   may be depreciated because the new variant of initialized children is better to use, more simple for usage. 
   *   But it should be compatible with older versions. 
   * <li>2013-12-08 Hartmut chg: {@link #reset(int, int)} is protected now and has a second parameter. necessary public? 
   * <li>2012-12-15 Hartmut chg: Some changes are done which cleans up this class. If any problem occurs, the {@link ByteDataAccessOld}
   *   can be used. It is compatible with the last version before this changes.
   *   <ul>
   *   <li>The currentChild is not necessary. The only reason to have that association is: changes of size in parent
   *     force changes in the current child. But it is contrary: The changes should be done in the child and should affect
   *     the indices in all parents which should be known all in the child. If a child is added and it is never used furthermore
   *     then an unnecessary dangling reference exists. If the child instance is reused and detach is not called, mistakes are happen.
   *   <li>the next() and rewind() are removed. It is an unused old concept.  
   *   </ul>
   * <li>2012-04-07 Hartmut new: {@link #reset(int)}, some comments.
   * <li>2012-03-00 Hartmut Note: compare it with java.nio.ByteBuffer. But a ByteBuffer is abstract.
   * <li>2010-12-20: Hartmut chg: remove the toString-method using StringFormatter, because it is too complex for C-usage.
   *   The toString was only able to use for debugging.
   * <li>2010-02-02: Hartmut new:  getChildFloat(), getChildDouble().
   * <li>2010-01-16: Hartmut chg:  setBigEndian in now public. It should be better because the same user data may be interpreted in both versions depending on a parameter.
   * <li>2005..2009: Hartmut: some changes
   * <li>2005 Hartmut created
