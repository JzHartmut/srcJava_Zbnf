  /**Version, history and license.
   * <ul>
   * <li>2016-09-18 Hartmut new: {@link #addCmd(CmdBlock, CmdGetterArguments)} new concept supports only {@link JZcmdExecuter}
   *   The {@link #addCmd(String, File, boolean)} and {@link #addCmd(String[], File, boolean)} is newly designed for simple operation system
   *   command execution without JZcmd concept. The {@link #addCmd(CmdBlock, File[], File)} which prepares file parts is designated as deprecated.
   *   Instead the JZcmdExecuter with more capability should be used. 
   * <li>2016-09-18 Hartmut chg: ctor with null as log, don't use log and JZcmd for simple applications. 
   * <li>2015-07-18 Hartmut chg: Now associated to an Appendable instead a PrintStream for error alive and error messages.
   *   A System.out is an Appendable too, for this kind the application is unchanged. Other output channels may support
   *   an Appendable rather than an PrintStream because it is more simple and substantial. 
   * <li>2013-09-08 Hartmut new: {@link #jzcmdExecuter} now included. TODO: it should use the {@link #executer}
   *   instead create a new one per call.
   * <li>2013-02-09 Hartmut chg: {@link #abortCmd()} now clears the queue too. The clearing of the command queue is a good idea, because while a program execution hangs, some unnecessary requests
   * may be initiated. 
   * <li>2013-02-03 Hartmut chg: better execution exception, uses log in {@link #execCmds(Appendable)}
   * <li>2013-02-03 Hartmut chg: {@link #execCmds(Appendable)} with only one parameter, the second one was unused.
   * <li>2011-12-03 Hartmut chg: The {@link #pendingCmds}-queue contains {@link PendingCmd} instead
   *   {@link CmdStore.CmdBlock} now. It is one level near on the really execution. A queued
   *   command may not stored in a CmdBlock. 
   * <li>2011-11-17 Hartmut new {@link #close()} to stop threads.
   * <li>2011-07-00 created
