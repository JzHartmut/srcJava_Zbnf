  /**Version, License and History:
   * <ul>
   * <li>2016-09-18 Hartmut new: {@link #addCmd(String[], String, List, List, File, ExecuteAfterFinish)} and {@link #executeCmdQueue(boolean)}.
   *   That is a new feature to store simple system commands. The class {@link CmdQueue} may be over-engineered for some applications. 
   * <li>2016-09-17 Hartmut new: {@link #execute(String[], boolean, String, List, List, ExecuteAfterFinish)} have the argument {@link ExecuteAfterFinish}.
   *   This method is executed in the {@link #outThread} after finishing the command and can evaluate the output of the command with a Java routine.
   *   The interface {@link ExecuteAfterFinish} can be overridden in any application for that appoach.   
   * <li>2016-08-26 Hartmut new: {@link #splitArgs(String, String[], String[])} with pre- and post-arguments. 
   *   Therewith both the invocation of a batch in Windows with "cmd.exe" can be organized as a Linux cmd with "sh.exe" can be invoked.
   *   The possibility {@link #execute(String, String, Appendable, Appendable, boolean)} with "useShell=true" is not the favor
   *   because it is only one of the necessities. Nevertheless it works now with initial setting of {@link #sConsoleInvocation}. 
   * <li>2015-07-18 Hartmut chg: Now on {@link #execute(String[], String, Appendable, Appendable)} etc. the error can be the same
   *   as the output. It is equate to error=null, only one output instance is used.
   * <li>2013-07-12 Hartmut new: {@link #execute(String[], boolean, String, List, List)} now with donotwait
   * <li>2013-07-12 Hartmut new: {@link #execute(String[], String, List, List)} for more as one output or error.
   *   It is nice to write a process output similar to the System.out and to a internal buffer while the process runs.
   *   Catching in a buffer and write to System.out after the process is finished is not fine if the process needs some time or hangs.
   * <li>2012-11-19 Hartmut bug: Command line arguments in "": now regarded in {@link #splitArgs(String)}.
   * <li>2012-02-02 Hartmut bug: Calling {@link #abortCmd()}: There was a situation were in {@link OutThread#run()} readline() hangs,
   *   though the {@link #process} was destroyed. It isn't solved yet. Test whether it may be better
   *   to read the InputStread direct without wrapping with an BufferedReader. 
   * <li>2011-12-31 Hartmut bugfix: The OutThread doesn't realize that the process was finished,
   *   because BufferedReader.ready() returns false and the buffer was not checked. So 'end of file'
   *   was not detected. Therefore {@link OutThread#bProcessIsRunning} set to false to abort waiting.
   * <li>2011-11-17 Hartmut new {@link #close()} to stop threads.
   * <li>2011-10-09 Hartmut chg: rename 'execWait' to {@link #execute(String, String, Appendable, Appendable)}
   *   because it has the capability of no-wait too.
   * <li>2011-10-09 Hartmut new: {@link #abortCmd()}. experience: On windows the output getting thread may block.   
   * <li>2011-10-08 chg the {@link #execute(String[], String, Appendable, Appendable)} waits until 
   *   all outputs are gotten in the {@link #outThread} and errThread. Extra class {@link OutThread}
   *   for both errThread and outThread.
   * <li>2011-10-02 chg some experiences: It needs parallel threads to capture the output. Extra threads
   *   for out and err, because a read() waits in the out-Buffer and blocks while an error-info is present etc.
   *   The outputs should presented while the process runs, not only if it is finished. It is because
   *   the user should be informed why a process blocks or waits for something etc. This fact is implemented already
   *   in {@link org.vishia.mainCmd.MainCmd#executeCmdLine(String[], ProcessBuilder, int, Appendable, String)}.
