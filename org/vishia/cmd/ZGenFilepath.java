/**This class describes a file entity in a executer level of ZGen. The file entity can contain wild cards.
 * It can refer to a variable which contains the base path.
 * It may be a absolute or a relative path. It can have a base path and a local path part.
 * This class contains only the reference to the {@link ZGenExecuter.ExecuteLevel} where this variable is located
 * and a reference to the {@link ZGenScript.Filepath}. The last one contains all information about the
 * file entity. This class is used to get all presentation possibilities of the file. Therefore the current directory
 * should be known which is given in the ZGen executer level. 
 * <ul>
 * <li><b>localpath</b>:
 *   If you write <code>anyPath/path:localPath/path/file.ext</code> then it describes a path which part 
 *    from <code>localPath</code> can be used as path to the file in some scripts. 
 *    <ul>
 *    <li>For example in C-compilation object-files can be stored in sub directories of the objects destination directory 
 *      which follows this local path designation.
 *    <li>Another example: copying some files from one directory location to another in designated sub directories.
 *    </ul> 
 * <li><b>General path</b>: If this file entry is member of a file set, the file set can have a general path.
 *   It is given by the {@link UserFileset#srcpath}. A given general path is used for all methods. 
 *   Only this entry describes an absolute path the general path is not used. 
 * <li><b>Drive letter or select path</b>: On windows systems a drive letter can be used in form <code>A:</code>.
 *   The path should not be absolute. For example <code>"X:mypath\file.ext"</code> describes a file starting from the 
 *   current directory of the <code>X</code> drive. Any drive has its own current directory. A user can use this capability
 *   of windows to set different current directories in special maybe substitute drives.
 * <li><b>Drive letter as select path</b>:  
 *   It may be possible (future extension) to use this capability independent of windows in this class. 
 *   For that the {@link #itsFileset} can have some paths associated to drive letters with local meaning,
 *   If the path starts with a drive letter, the associated path is searched in the parents drive list. 
 * <li><b>Absolute path</b>: If this entry starts with slash or backslash, maybe after a drive designation for windows systems,
 *   it is an absolute path. Elsewhere the parent's general path can be absolute. If an absolute path is requested
 *   calling {@link #absFile()} or adequate and the path is not given as absolute path, then the current directory is used
 *   as prefix for the path. The current directory is a property of the {@link UserScript#sCurrDir}. The current directory
 *   of the operation system is not used for that. 
 * <li><b>operation systems current directory</b>: In opposite if you generate a relative path and the executing system
 *   expects a normal path then it may use the operation system's current directory. But that behaviour is outside of this tool.
 * <li><b>Slash or backslash</b>: The user script can contain slash characters for path directory separation also for windows systems.
 *   It is recommended to use slash. The script which should be generate may expect back slashes on windows systems.
 *   Therefore all methods which returns a path are provided in 2 forms: <b>With "W" on end</b> of there name it is the <b>Windows version</b>
 *   which converts given slash characters in backslash in its return value. So the generated script will contain backslash characters.
 *   Note that some tools in windows accept a separation with slash too. Especial in C-sources an <code>#include <path/file.h></code>
 *   should be written with slash or URLs (hyperlinks) should be written with slash in any case.    
 * <li><b>Return value of methods</b>: All methods which assembles parts of the path returns a {@link java.lang.CharSequence}.
 *   The instance type of the CharSequence is either {@link java.lang.String} or {@link java.lang.StringBuilder}.
 *   It is not recommended that a user casts the instance type to StringBuilder, then changes it, stores references and
 *   expects that is unchanged. Usual either references to {@link java.lang.CharSequence} or {@link java.lang.String} are expected
 *   as argument type for further processing. If a String is need, one can invoke returnValue.toString(); 
 *   <br><br>
 *   The usage of a {@link java.lang.CharSequence} saves memory space in opposite to concatenate Strings and then return
 *   a new String. In user algorithms it may be recommended to use  {@link java.lang.CharSequence} argument types 
 *   instead {@link java.lang.String} if the reference is not stored permanently but processed immediately.
 *   <br><br> 
 *   If a reference is stored for a longer time in multithreading or in complex algorithms, a {@link java.lang.String}
 *   preserves that the content of the referenced String is unchanged in any case. A {@link java.lang.CharSequence} does not
 *   assert that it is unchanged in any case. Therefore in that case the usage of {@link java.lang.String} is recommended.
 * </ul>
 * <br><br>
 * <b>Handling of Wildcards</b>:<br>
 * If a UserFilepath is used in {@link Zmake}, the {@link ZmakeUserScript.UserTarget#allInputFilesExpanded()}
 * expands given files with wildcards in a list of existing files. That's result are instances of this class which
 * does no more contain wildcards, because they are expanded already. The expand algorithm is given with
 * {@link org.vishia.util.FileSystem#addFilesWithBasePath(File, String, List)}.
 * <br><br>
 * If the file designation of this class contains wildcards (in Zmake for example an <code><*$target.output.file()></code>
 * either the wildcards are present in the returned value of the access methods or that type of access methods
 * which have a argument 'replWildc' are used.
 * <br><br>
 * <b>Replace wildcards</b>:<br>
 * All methods with 'replWildc'-argument does the following:
 * <ul>
 * <li>The first "*" or "**" wildcard in the local path part is replaced by the whole local path part of the replWildc-argument.
 *   Usual the local path part of this consists only of a "**" or it consists of a path ending with "**" or it contains
 *   a prefix and a postfix like "pre/ ** /post". All variants may be proper. 
 * <li>The first "*" in the name is replaced by the whole name of the 'replWildc' argument. Usual the name may consist only
 *   of a single "*".
 * <li>The second "*" in the name is replaced by the whole ext of the 'replWildc' argument. Usual the name.ext of this 
 *   may consist of "*.*.ext". See examples.      
 * </ul>       
 * Examples
 * <table><tr><th>this </th><th> replWildc</th><th>result</th></tr>
 * <tr><td>** / *.*.ext</td><td>rlocal/rpath/rname.rxt</td><td>rlocal/rpath/rname.rxt.ext</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>local/path / *.*.ext</td><td>rlocal/rpath/rname.rxt</td><td>local/path/rname.rxt.ext</td></tr>
