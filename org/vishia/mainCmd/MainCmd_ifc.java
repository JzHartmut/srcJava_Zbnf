    The interface Report is extended here, so all report things are also accessable via this interface.

      @param nReportLevel Determines the kind of writing the output. Possible values are 1..6 using Report.error to Report.fineInfo

                          and the error output is written with Report(1, ...).
      @param output    If not null, than the stdout is written in this Buffer. If null, the stdout is written to report.
      @param input     If not null, this input is send to the cmdline process. If null, no input is send.
