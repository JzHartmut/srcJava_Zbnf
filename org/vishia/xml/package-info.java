/**This package contains XML-functionality, which works especially with the Saxon-XSLT.
 * While compiling the Saxon-XSLT should not be present because it is instantiated using
 * symbolic access (reflection). Therefore any other XSLT with the same interface can be used too.
 * For running either the SAXON-classes should be present or the instantiation should determine
 * any other translator package.
