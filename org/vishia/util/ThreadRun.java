/**This class builds a Thread which runs a routine in a cycle.
 * The intension for an extra class is: On debugging, if a source is changed while running a program,
 * it can reloaded normally for example on eclipse working. But sometimes that is only possible if
 * the CPU does not run in the byteCode of that source. If the thread's loop is part of that source,
 * the class may not able to reload and the debugging is 'out of sync' with the sources.
 * This extra class enables the change of the working class because the CPU is on waiting in this class
 * usual, respectively a thread can hold here by setting a breakpoint.
