/**Supports individual handling of assertions especially in debug phase. 
 * The application can create any special Assert class which extends this class
 * and override the both methods {@link #assertion(boolean)} and {@link #assertion(boolean, String)}.
 * The special instance can be set for the whole application calling {@link #setAssertionInstance(Assert)}.
 * It is also be possible to use a special assertion instance.
 * <br><br>
 * To check any assertion one can use the static methods 
 * <pre>
 * Assert.check(condition);
 * Assert.check(condition, msg);
 * </pre>
 * Then either this class (self instantiating) or the application wide Assert object is used.
 * <br>
 * The other possibility is, use a special modul-wide Assert object:
 * <pre>
 * Assert assert = new MyAssert();
 * ...
 * assert.assertion(condition);
 * assert.assertion(condition, msg);
 * </pre>

   * <li>2012-08-30 Hartmut some enhancements, especially assert with send a message to System.err.
   * <li>2012-01-19 Hartmut created. The reason was: set an individual breakpoint on assertion statement.
   *   The second reason: flexibility for debugging. The java language 'assert' is too less in functionality.
