/**This class describes a File, which may be localized at any maybe remote device or which may be a normal local file. 
 * A remote file should be accessed by FileRemoteChannel implementations. It may be any information
 * at an embedded hardware, not only in a standard network.
 * This class executes a remote access only if properties of the file are requested.
 * It stores information about the file without access. 
 * <br><br>
 * This class inherits from java.lang.File. The advantage is:
 * <ul>
 * <li>The class File defines the interface to the remote files too. No extra definition of access methods is need.
 * <li>Any reference to a file can store the reference to a remote file too.
 * <li>The implementation for local files is given without additional effort.
 * </ul> 
 * If the file is a local file, the standard java file access algorithm are used.

   * <li>2011-12-10 Hartmut creation: It is needed for {@link org.vishia.commander.Fcmd}, this tool
   *   should work with remote files with any protocol for example FTP. But firstly it is implemented and tested
   *   only for local files. The concept is: 
   *   <ul>
   *   <li>All relevant information about a file are stored locally in this instance if they are known.
   *   <li>If information are unknown, on construction 'unknown' is stored, no access occurs.
   *     But if they are requested, an access is done.
   *   <li>Any instance of the interface {@link FileRemoteAccessor} is responsible to execute the remote access.
   *   <li>The access to local files are done with this class directly.
   *   </ul>
   * </ul>
