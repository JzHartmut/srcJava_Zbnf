 * This class executes a remote access only if properties of the file are requested.
 * It stores information about the file without access. 
 * <br><br>
 * This class inherits from java.lang.File. The advantage is:
 * <ul>
 * <li>The class File defines the interface to the remote files too. No extra definition of access methods is need.
 * <li>Any reference to a file can store the reference to a remote file too.
 * <li>The implementation for local files is given without additional effort.
 * </ul> 
 * If the file is a local file, the standard java file access algorithm are used.

  /**Version, history and license.
   * <ul>
   * <li>2012-03-10 Hartmut new: {@link #chgProps(String, int, int, long, Callback)}, {@link #countAllFileLength(Callback)}.
   *   Enhancements.
   * <li>2012-02-02 Hartmut chg: Now the {@link #sFile} (renamed from name) is empty if this describes
   *   an directory and it is known that it is an directory. The ctor is adapted therefore.
   *   {@link #getParent()} is changed. Some assertions are set.
   * <li>2012-02-02 Hartmut chg: Handling of relative paths: It is detected in ctor. TODO relative paths are not tested well. 
   * <li>2012-01-14 Hartmut chg: The toplevel directory contains only one slash in the {@link #sDir}
   *   and an empty name in {@link #name}. 
   * <li>2012-01-14 Hartmut new: {@link #getParentFile()} now implemented here.  
   * <li>2012-01-14 Hartmut new: {@link #fromFile(File)} to convert from a normal File instance.
   * <li>2012-01-06 Hartmut new: Some functionality for {@link #_setProperties(long, long, int, Object)}
   *   and symbolic linked paths.
   * <li>2012-01-01 Hartmut new: {@link #oFile}. In the future the superclass File should be used only as interface.
   *   TODO: For any file access the oFile-instance should be used by {@link #device}.
   * <li>2012-01-01 Hartmut new: {@link #copyTo(FileRemote, Event)}
   * <li>2011-12-10 Hartmut creation: It is needed for {@link org.vishia.commander.Fcmd}, this tool
   *   should work with remote files with any protocol for example FTP. But firstly it is implemented and tested
   *   only for local files. The concept is: 
   *   <ul>
   *   <li>All relevant information about a file are stored locally in this instance if they are known.
   *   <li>If information are unknown, on construction 'unknown' is stored, no access occurs.
   *     But if they are requested, an access is done.
   *   <li>Any instance of the interface {@link FileRemoteAccessor} is responsible to execute the remote access.
   *   <li>The access to local files are done with this class directly.
   *   </ul>
