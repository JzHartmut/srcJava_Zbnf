/**This class describes a File, which may be localized at any maybe remote device or which may be a normal local file. 
 * A remote file should be accessed by FileRemoteChannel implementations. It may be any information
 * at an embedded hardware, not only in a standard network.
 * This class executes a remote access only if properties of the file are requested.
 * It stores information about the file without access. 
 * <br><br>
 * This class inherits from java.lang.File. The advantage is:
 * <ul>
 * <li>The class File defines the interface to the remote files too. No extra definition of access methods is need.
 * <li>Any reference to a file can store the reference to a remote file too.
 * <li>The implementation for local files is given without additional effort.
 * </ul> 
 * If the file is a local file, the standard java file access algorithm are used.

  /**Version, history and license.
   * <ul>
   * <li>2012-08-11 Hartmut new: method {@link #openInputStream(long)}. An application may need that, for example to create
   *   a {@link java.io.Reader} with the input stream. Some implementations, especially a local file and a {@link java.util.zip.ZipFile}
   *   supports that. An {@link java.io.InputStream} may force a blocking if data are not available yet for file in a remote device
   *   but that may be accepted. 
   * <li> 2012-08-11 Hartmut new: {@link #listFiles(FileFilter)} now implemented here. 
   * <li>2012-08-05 Hartmut chg: The super class File needs the correct path. So it is able to use for a local file nevertheless.
   *   What is with oFile if it is a FileRemote? should refer this? See change from 2012-01-01.
   * <li>2012-08-03 Hartmut chg: Usage of Event in FileRemote. 
   *   The FileRemoteAccessor.Commission is removed yet. The same instance FileRemote.Callback, now named FileRemote.FileRemoteEvent is used for forward event (commision) and back event.
   * <li>2012-07-28 Hartmut chg: Concept of remote files enhanced with respect to {@link FileAccessZip}.
   *   <ul>
   *   <li>New references {@link #parent} and {@link #children}. They are filled calling {@link #refreshPropertiesAndChildren(CallbackEvent)}.
   *   <li>More separation of java.io.File accesses. In the past only the local files were supported really.
   *   <li>new interface {@link FileRemoteAccessorSelector} and {@link #setAccessorSelector(FileRemoteAccessorSelector)}.
   *     The user can have any algorithm to select a {@link FileRemoteAccessor} depending on the
   *     path of the file. A prefix String may determine how the file is to access. If that routine
   *     is not called, the {@link FileRemoteAccessorLocalFile#selectLocalFileAlways}.
   *   <li>{@link #FileRemote(FileRemoteAccessor, FileRemote, String, String, long, long, int, Object)}
   *     has the parent as parameter. The parameter oFileP is stored now. It is any data to access the file object.
   *   <li>The constructor had access the file if length=-1 was given. But that is not the convention.
   *     An access may need execution and waiting time for a remote communication. The constructor
   *     should never wait. Instead the methods:
   *   <li>{@link #refreshProperties(CallbackEvent)} and {@link #refreshPropertiesAndChildren(CallbackEvent)}
   *     have to be called if the properties of the real file on the local system (java.io.File)
   *     or any remote system are need. That routines envisages the continuation of working
   *     with a callback event are invocation mechanism. For example if the file properties
   *     should be shown in a graphic application, the building of the graphic can't stop and wait 
   *     for more as some 100 milliseconds. It is better to clear a table and continue working in graphic. 
   *     If the properties are gotten from the remote system then the table will be filled.
   *     That may be invoked from another thread, the communication thread for the remote device
   *     or by an event mechanism (see {@link FileRemote.CallbackEvent} respectively {@link org.vishia.util.Event}.
   *   <li>The routine {@link #fromFile(File)} reads are properties of a local file if one is given.
   *     In that case the {@link #refreshProperties(CallbackEvent)} need not be invoked additionally.
   *   <li>{@link #openRead(long)} and {@link #openWrite(long)} accepts a non-given device.
   *     They select it calling {@link FileRemoteAccessorSelector#selectFileRemoteAccessor(String)}
   *   <li>All get methods {@link #length}, {@link #lastModified()}, {@link #isDirectory()} etc.
   *     now returns only the stored values. It may necessary to invoke {@link #refreshProperties(CallbackEvent)}
   *     in the application before they are called to get the correct values. The refreshing
   *     can't be called in that getter routines because they should not wait for communication.
   *     In the case of local files that access may be shorten in time, but it isn't known
   *     whether it is a local file. The user algorithm should work with remote files too if they are
   *     tested locally only. Therefore a different strategy to access properties are not proper to use.
   *   <li>{@link #getParentFile()} now uses the {@link #parent} reference. If it is null,
   *     a new FileRemote instance for the parent is created, but without access to the file,
   *     only with knowledge of the path string. Because the {@link #FileRemote(FileRemoteAccessor, FileRemote, String, String, long, long, int, Object)}
   *     will be gotten the parent of it too, all parent instances will be set recursively then.
   *   <li>{@link #listFiles()} now returns the {@link #children} only. If the user has not called
   *     {@link #refreshPropertiesAndChildren(CallbackEvent)}, it is empty.           
   *   </ul>
   * <li>2012-07-21 Hartmut new: {@link #delete(String, boolean, Event)} with given mask. TODO: It should done in 
   *   {@link org.vishia.util.FileRemoteAccessorLocalFile} in an extra thread.
   * <li>2012-03-10 Hartmut new: {@link #chgProps(String, int, int, long, CallbackEvent)}, {@link #countAllFileLength(CallbackEvent)}.
   *   Enhancements.
   * <li>2012-02-02 Hartmut chg: Now the {@link #sFile} (renamed from name) is empty if this describes
   *   an directory and it is known that it is an directory. The ctor is adapted therefore.
   *   {@link #getParent()} is changed. Some assertions are set.
   * <li>2012-02-02 Hartmut chg: Handling of relative paths: It is detected in ctor. TODO relative paths are not tested well. 
   * <li>2012-01-14 Hartmut chg: The toplevel directory contains only one slash in the {@link #sDir}
   *   and an empty name in {@link #key}. 
   * <li>2012-01-14 Hartmut new: {@link #getParentFile()} now implemented here.  
   * <li>2012-01-14 Hartmut new: {@link #fromFile(File)} to convert from a normal File instance.
   * <li>2012-01-06 Hartmut new: Some functionality for {@link #_setProperties(long, long, int, Object)}
   *   and symbolic linked paths.
   * <li>2012-01-01 Hartmut new: {@link #oFile}. In the future the superclass File should be used only as interface.
   *   TODO: For any file access the oFile-instance should be used by {@link #device}.
   * <li>2012-01-01 Hartmut new: {@link #copyTo(FileRemote, Event)}
   * <li>2011-12-10 Hartmut creation: It is needed for {@link org.vishia.commander.Fcmd}, this tool
   *   should work with remote files with any protocol for example FTP. But firstly it is implemented and tested
   *   only for local files. The concept is: 
   *   <ul>
   *   <li>All relevant information about a file are stored locally in this instance if they are known.
   *   <li>If information are unknown, on construction 'unknown' is stored, no access occurs.
   *     But if they are requested, an access is done.
   *   <li>Any instance of the interface {@link FileRemoteAccessor} is responsible to execute the remote access.
   *   <li>The access to local files are done with this class directly.
   *   </ul>
