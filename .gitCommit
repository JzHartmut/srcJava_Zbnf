Some news, DataAccess.debugMethod("") and StringPartScan.scanStart(true)
* DataAccess: {@link #debugMethod(String)} can be invoked with "". Then it invokes {@link #debug()} on the next found method
  and removes the settings after them. It is usual in a JZtxtcmd Script to stop on the next method.
* StringPartScan: {@link #scanStart(boolean)} possible to switch on bSkipWhitepaces. More simple for invocation.
