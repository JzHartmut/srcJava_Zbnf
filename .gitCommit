CmdQueue: new interface CmdGetterArguments. org.vishia.fileRemote.FileRemoteCallbackCmp bugfix.
CmdQueue: The old org.vishia.cmd.PrepareCmd should be eliminated 
because the JZcmd is the better one solution to execute commands with complex arguments meanwhile. That should be done because
the arguments for JZcmd should be more complex for the application the.File.commander: List of files should be used too.
For that the interface org.vishia.cmd.CmdGetFileArgs_ifc is not sufficient. 
This interface is common for JZcmd and the older 'PrepareCmd' yet now, but not for future. 
Because it will be incompatible, the maintenance of the older PrepareCmd is not efficient and the older class is unnecessary.
* org.vishia.cmd.CmdGetterArguments: new interface
* org.vishia.cmd.PrepareCommand and ~.CmdGetFileArgs_ifc: now deprecated.
* org.vishia.cmd.CmdQueue: new method addCommand(..., CmdGetterArguments) and addCommand(cmdString, ...)
* org.vishia.cmd.CmdStore: addSubOfJZcmdClass(...) changed.
* org.vishia.fileRemote.FileRemoteCallbackCmp bugfix
* org.vishia.msgDispatch.MsgDispatcher: some changes for Java2C
* org.vishia.util.StringPart: some changes for Java2C
