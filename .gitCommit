FileCluster: On {@link #getFile(CharSequence, CharSequence, boolean)} only {@link FileSystem#normalizePath(CharSequence)}
  is invoked. Not {@link FileSystem#getCanonicalPath(File)}: Reason: On this access the operation system's file system must not accessed.
  Only an existing {@link FileRemote} instance is searched and returned. Especially if a network directory is accessed and the
  network is not accessible, this invocation must not hang! It is used in the graphic thread in the org.vishia.commander.
