bugfixes and comment, new: StringFunctions.cNoCidentifier
* FileRemote: the StringPart.close() was fatal because that StringPart was used after them.  
* StringPartScan, StringFunctions.cNoCidentifier: It is a special character which checks a non-identifier character at end of a scanned text.
* SpecialCharStrings, StringFunctions, StringPart: the definition of cStartOfText and cEndOfText is defined only one time.
