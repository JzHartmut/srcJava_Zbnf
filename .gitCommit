JZcmdExecuter, JZcmdScript: chg: On any call of execute(...) or execSub(..) the given script will be used as current and replaces an old one. 
 If it is another script as the last one, the new script will be established. 
 It means, the existing script variables are deleted and the script variables of the new given script are calculated and stored.
 If the script is the same, the variables won't be replaced. It is a spare of time, but also additional variables will be kept.
 The new rule is: the JZcmdExecuter can be used for several scripts one after another (in one thread). The current script wins.
