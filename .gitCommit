StringPartFromFileLines now works with lesser buffer. IndexMultiTable with inherited root element.
* StringPartFromFileLines 
* IndexMultiTable: The root element is removed, instead this class extends a Table which is the root table.
  Only one advantage: 1 level lesser for debug-show of the data. But that may be proper for deep nested trees.
  For the change: The inner class Table is moved to an own {@link IndexMultiTable_Table} class.
  Some delegate methods are overridden now (clear), therefore super.clear() is called, to prevent circular invocation.
  No functional changes. 
* StringFunctions: new: {@link #nrofBytesUTF8(byte)} used in {@link StringPartFromFileLines}     
* StringPartScan: chg: {@link #scan()} now invokes {@link #scanStart()} automatically, it is the common use case.
* XmlReader,XmlCfg progress, not ready.
