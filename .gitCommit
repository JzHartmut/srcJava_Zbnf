Bugfix org.vishia.util.IndexMultiTable, org.vishia.util.StringFunctions_C.parseFloat
* IndexMultiTable: check whether a table is not instanceof IndexMultiTable itself.
* IndexMultiTable: The usage of <code>IndexMultiTable.super</code> works in Oracle-Java version 8.102, but not in a lesser version.
  To save compatibility it is avoided. Sometimes a typed meta variable is the better solution in any case.
* StringFunctions: byte2UTF8 returns short than char because of usage in C.
* StringFunctions_C: bugfix: {@link #parseFloat(CharSequence, int, int, char, int[])} has had a problem with 1 digit after decimal point.
* XmlReader: now reads from a zip file.
* LogMessageFile, ByteDataAccessBase: non functional change for Java2C
